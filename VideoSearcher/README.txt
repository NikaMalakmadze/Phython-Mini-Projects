Hi!

This is my project made of different python libraries!

Name: "VideoSearcher"

it's a Python Code that can search videos in the inputed folder and show you various information, like:
        1. Time searched, proccessed, cache saved
        2. Total & Average duration of all videos
        3. Total & Average size of all videos
        4. Longest and Largest videos
        and more

Libraries used: os, cv2, json, time and datetime

This Python code can be useful when you want to find out how many videos you have in specific folder
and additionaly get some information about them

There's also cache json file that stores proccessed videos, so code will not loose time to procces them again 

You need to have json file in the same folder with the actual Python code
Then you have to input name of the json file in specific constant variable in Python file.
Run main.py

AND

Have Fun!
