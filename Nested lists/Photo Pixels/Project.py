#Photo Pixels|CodeForces Task|

#The photo is a matrix of size n Ã— m, in each cell of which a symbol is stored, indicating the color of the corresponding pixel. There are 6 colors:
# "C"(cyan) "M"(magenta) "Y"(yellow) "W"(white) "G"(grey) "B"(black)
#A photo can be considered black and white if it contains only white, gray or black color. If at least one pixel of blue, purple or yellow color is present, it is colored.
