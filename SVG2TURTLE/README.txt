Hi!

This is my project made of different python libraries!

Name: "SVG2TURTLE"

it's a Python Code that Converts SVG image into turtle graphics! (See Ouptut img)

Libraries used: Turtle, svg2paths2 and random

actually you can convert any image format into svg and then use it generate turtle graphics

I would recommend adobe's svg converter

anyway, I have only tested such svg images ;

1. Open main.py 

2. put absolute path to svg image

3. Run main.py

AND

Have Fun!
