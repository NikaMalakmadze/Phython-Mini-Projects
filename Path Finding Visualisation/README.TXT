Hi!

This is my project made of different python libraries!

Name: "Path Finding Algorithms Visualisation"

it's a Python Code that visualises working of different path finder Algorithms!

Libraries used: Tkinter, pygame, mazelib and more.

There are 8 modules:
                        1. Algorithms 
                        2. Cell Object
                        3. Grid
                        4. Maze
                        5. Settings
                        6. UI
                        7. Utilities(helper functions)
                        8. Main

In the future i think i will add more Algorithms.

P.S U can change different properties in Settings module

Run main.py

AND

Have Fun!
